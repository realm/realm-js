# Realm SDK for Node.js
Use the Realm SDK for Node.js to build for server applications, desktop
applications, CLIs, IoT programs, and more in JavaScript or TypeScript.

The Node.js SDK does not support applications written for web browsers.
For Web apps, use the Web SDK.
For React Native development, use the React Native SDK.

To get started with the Node.js SDK, see [Quick Start](quick-start.md).

## Develop Apps with the SDK
Use the SDK's open-source database - Realm - as an object store on the device.

### Install the Node.js SDK
To get started, install the Node.js SDK.

### Define an Object Schema
Use JavaScript to idiomatically define an object schema.

### Configure & Open a Database
You can configure your database to do things
like populate initial data on load, use an encryption key to
secure data, and more. To begin working with your data,
configure and open a database.

### Read and Write Data
You can create, read, update, and delete objects
from the device database. Construct complex queries to
filter data.

### React to Changes
Live objects mean that your data is always up-to-date.
Register a change listener to react to changes
and perform logic like updating your UI.
