?.?.? Release notes (2020-??-??)
=============================================================

### Breaking changes
* Renamed `Realm.app` to `Realm.getApp` to make it less conflicting with a local `app` variable.

### Enhancements
* Added an export of the `ObjectId` BSON type on the package namespace. ([#3071](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3071))
* Added an IIFE bundle enabling users to consume the package from a script-tag. ([#3071](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3071))
* Upon authenticating with an OAuth 2.0 authentication provider (Google, Facebook or Apple), the promise returned by `logIn` will get rejected with an error, messaged "Window closed". ([#3064](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3064))

0.7.0 Release notes (2020-07-13)
=============================================================

### Enhancements
* Added `Credentials.userApiKey` and `Credentials.serverApiKey` as aliases for `Credentials.apiKey`.
* Exposed the `ApiKeyAuth` auth provider client on `user.apiKeys`.

* Fixed refreshing of access tokens upon 401 responses from the server. ([#3020](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3020))
