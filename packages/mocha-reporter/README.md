# @realm/mocha-reporter

This is our internal mocha-reporter.  It expands on the default Spec reporter from mocha
to include timestamps and direct error messages on failed tests.

In the App Services logs, the timestamps can be used to see if there was some sort of failure
that caused the test not to pass.

This is an internal package of Realm JS, not intended for public consumption.
