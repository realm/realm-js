# React Native Template Realm TypeScript

## Usage

Simple React Native template to quickly get started with Realm.

This app implements a simple todo list, using Realm for persistence and the [Realm React](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/tree/master/packages/realm-react) hooks for React integration. It supports sync, allowing users to login and sync their todo lists across multiple devices.

## üöÄ How to use

```
npx react-native init AwesomeRealmProject --template @realm/react-native-template-ts
```

## üèÉ How to build and run locally

- [Setup React Native development Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- Build/Run on iOS üçé
```
npm run ios
```
- Build/Run on Android ü§ñ
```
npm run android
```

## üíª Start the Dev Client

```
npm start
```

## üíæ Testing changes to the template when developing

To test the template locally, run it like any other React Native app: `npm i && npx pod-install` then `npm run ios`.

## üîÄ Setting up sync

### Setting up a Realm app in the cloud

To enable sync, first you need to register for MongoDB Atlas and set up a new free Realm app:

1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register and register a new account and fill out the initial questionaire
2. On the "deploy a cloud database" screen, click "I'll do this later" (in the bottom left)
3. From the Atlas homepage, click on the Realm tab at the top
4. From the "Welcome to MongoDB Realm" wizard, select "Build your own app" and click "Next"
5. Accept the default values for data source, application and deployment model by clicking "Create Realm Application"
6. Close the "Welcome to your Application Guides" popup
7. Choose "Sync" from the left hand menu
8. Press "Start Syncing"
9. In the "Already have data in Atlas?" popup, click "No thanks, continue to Sync"
10. Under "Select Development Details", ensure "Partition Based" sync is selected, and turn "Development Mode" on
11. From "Select a cluster to sync", select "RealmCluster"
12. From "Select or add a database name", select "Add new database", then in the "Create a new database name" box, enter "todolist" and click "Create"
11. For "Choose a partition key", select "Select or create a partition key field name" and enter "userId" in the "Enter your new option here box", then click "Create", then select "string" as the field type
11. Under "Define permissions", select the "Users can only read and write their own data" template
12. Click the "Enable Sync" button at the bottom and in the "Confirm" popup, click "Enable Sync" again
13. At the top of the screen, click "Review draft & deploy", and in the "Deployment Draft" popup, click the "Deploy" button (you will not have to do this for future changes while you are in development mode)
14. Go to "Authentication" from the left hand menu
15. Click "Edit" on the "Email/Password" provider row
16. Set "Provider Enabled" to "On"
17. Set "User Confirmation Method" to "Automatically confirm users"
18. Enter any URL (e.g. "https://mongodb.com") for the "Password Reset URL" box (in a real app, this would be a page on your server which allows users to reset their password)
19. Click the "Save" button

### Enabling sync in the template app

To enable sync in the template app:

1. Open `app/config/sync.ts` in a text editor
2. Change `enabled: false` on line 20 to `enabled: true`
3. Copy your Realm app ID by clicking on the copy icon at the top of the left hand menu (it will say "Application-0" if you are using the defaults) ‚Äì this will be something like "application-0-abcde"
4. Change `realmAppId: "<Your App ID>"` on line 22 to use your app ID, e.g. `realmAppId: "application-0-abcde"`
5. Restart the app and you will be asked to login or register ‚Äì start by registering a new account
6. Once you are logged in, you will see your tasks ‚Äì if you login with the same user on another device, you will see that the two are in sync
7. You can press "log out" at the bottom of the screen and login or register as another user

### Enabling anonymous authentication

Anonymous authentication allows users to sync data without being logged in. This can be useful to allow users to try out the app before registering, see https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/authentication/anonymous/ for more details.

1. Open `app/config/sync.ts` in a text editor
2. Change `anonymousAuthEnabled: false` on line 20 to `anonymousAuthEnabled: true`
3. When you are logged out, you can now still interact with the todo list as an anonymous user.
