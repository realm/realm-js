# Support

The Realm team is here to help you with your Realm-related issues!

## Documentation

Before asking questions, please familiarize yourself with our [Node.js](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/node/) and [React Native](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/react-native/) documentation. 

## MongoDB Developer Community

If you have questions about configuring or using Realm you can ask the [MongoDB Developer Community](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/).

When asking questions the MongoDB Developer Community, please keep in mind the [guidelines](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/guidelines), and please use the search functionality to see if your question has been asked before.

## GitHub Issues

If you are running into issues with Realm, including potential bugs or feature requests, we encourage you to file an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues). Please check out our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to properly file an issue.

We greatly appreciate demonstration projects that we can run for ourselves in order to see issues or potential bugs; we prioritize clearly-written tickets that include reproduction cases. You may attach these to the ticket; let us know if you need to share them confidentially, and we’ll provide instructions on how to do so.
