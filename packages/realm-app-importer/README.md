# Realm App Importer

Imports an app directory into Atlas App Services.

This CLI works around a few shortcomings of the official Realm CLI - most notably around import of apps referencing secrets and the fact that the CLI updates apps (leaving upstages changes to app directories, degrading developer experience).

The CLI provides two commands:
- **import** (the default command): Called to import a single app: The server creates an app id based on the apps name. This command also help you to inject this id into other tools by either saving it to a file or serving it over HTTP.
- **serve**: Start an HTTP server allowing other processes (such as an integration test suite) to import apps on demand, without having to provide credentials or have direct file-system access to the app template directories.

## Importing an app

If you don't have an app to import, read the section on "exporting" below.

Ensure you have this CLI installed in your project as a dev-dependency.

    npm install realm-app-importer --save-dev

When you have a templated app that you want to download (stored in ./my-app-template for example), run

    npx realm-app-importer ./my-app-template

To import secrets add a secrets.json to the template directory, containing a single JSON object with keys and string values:

```json
{
	"my-secret": "v3ry-s3cr3t"
}
```

                                                       [boolean] [default: true]
```

Besides the `<template-path>` the CLI takes a few optional runtime parameters, most of which should be self-explainatory and set to defaults that should ease the usecase of integration tests against local deployments.

When using the `import` command, a consuming integration test can to get a hold of the id of the app, in a couple of ways:

1. the consuming test harness can use the package programmatically, instantiating the `AppImporter` class and calling its `importApp` method, which returns a `Promise<{ appId: string }>`.
2. the `--app-id-path` runtime option saves the app id to a file, which can be read by the test harness.
3. the `--app-id-port` runtime option starts up a web-server on the specified port and serves the app id as a text response.

### Environment variables

Many of the runtime option's default values are configurable using environment variables:

- `--base-url` via `REALM_BASE_URL`
- `--username` via `REALM_USERNAME`
- `--password` via `REALM_PASSWORD`
- `--publicKey` via `REALM_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `--privateKey` via `REALM_PRIVATE_KEY`

## Exporting an app

Log into the official Stitch CLI:

    npx realm-cli login --api-key <your-api-key> --private-api-key <your-private-api-key>

Export a Stitch app that you want to import later

    npx realm-cli export --output ./my-app-template --as-template --app-id <your-app-id>

Where `<your-app-id>` is replaced with the app id found in the UI.

We're using the `--as-template` flag to ask the CLI to not store any ids into the exported files.

You might also need to specify a `--project-id` (equivalent with as group-id) in which the app was originally created.

See [the Realm CLI documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/deploy/realm-cli-reference/) for more information.
