# Realm Network Transport

Provides a shared abstraction defining how Realm JS (and it's packages) communicate over HTTP.

To update this package from the root Realm JS package, first pack and then install it

    npm pack ./packages/realm-network-transport
    npm install ./realm-network-transport-0.1.0.tgz

This installation process will change once the root package becomes a Lerna package itself.
