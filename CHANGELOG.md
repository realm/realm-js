=============================================================
### Breaking changes
* None

### Enhancements
* None

### Bug fixes
* `Realm.openAsync` will no longer open the realm if a sync error has occured. Previously this resulted in the callback being invoked twice - once with an error and a second time - with the synchronously opened Realm.
* Database adapters will no longer process the sync history of realm files that are not requested by the adapter configuration. Previously this would lead to crashes for realm files that contained schemas that don't define primary keys.

### Bug fixes
* Fix crash on Node.js when a listener callback throws an error.
  The error will now be forwarded to Node's fatal error handling facilities. This means better error reporting,
  the ability to debug such errors in a Node.js debugger, and proper invocation of the `uncaughtError` event on the `process` object.

* With this release we have switched over to a new cross platform compatible date format.
  This change will only require action from users who are using both the JS and Cocoa or Android

  open the Realm file with the latest version of the iOS or Android bindings before accessing the
  Realm from JS to prevent an unnecessary conversion.

### Bugfixes
