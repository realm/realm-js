# DISCLAIMER:
This is a _LIMITED_ mock for later replacement by the `UUID` implementation in [the official bson package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bson).
The code found here is _NOT_ production ready!

## TODO:
Delete this whole temp-folder once `UUID` is in the above mentioned package.

## Usage
To build `uuid.ts`, navigate to `/lib/temp/` & run `npx tsc`.
(output js-file is included in git for ease of use).
