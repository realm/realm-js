# Realm JS tests running in an Electron environment

To install this environment, run the following command from the root directory of repository:

```bash
npx lerna bootstrap --scope realm-electron-tests --include-dependencies
```

Currently this directory consists of:
- `runner.js` which start the Mocha remote server and the Electron app (using the distribution package when available).
- An electron app in `./app` where:
  - `main.js` starts a hidden `BrowserWindow` (loading `index.html`), which either runs the tests (if `processType` is `main`) or lets the render process do the heavy lifting (when `processType` is `renderer`).
  - `index.html` simply requires the `renderer.js` file - nothing fancy.
  - `renderer.js` detects if it's supposed to run the tests and runs them.
  - `mocha.js` creates a mocha remote client and sets globals for the tests to use.

## Running the tests

To run tests in the main process:

    npm run test:main

To run tests in a renderer process:

    npm run test:renderer

To run tests in both processes in sequence:

    npm test

To package the test app for distribution:

    npm run package -- [{arguments for electron-builder}](https://www.electron.build/cli).
