![Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/raw/master/logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This project hosts the JavaScript versions of [Realm](https://realm.io/). Currently we only support React Native (both iOS & Android) and Node.js (on MacOS and Linux) but we are considering adding support for Cordova/PhoneGap/Ionic as well.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/#models) and [queryable by code](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/#queries), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, and vectorization.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.

## Getting Started

Please see the detailed instructions in our docs to use [Realm Javascript](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/#getting-started).

## Building Realm

In case you don't want to use the precompiled version on npm, you can build Realm yourself from source. You’ll need an Internet connection the first time you build in order to download the core library.

Prerequisites:
- Node: 4.0 <= version < 7.0
- Xcode 7.2+
- Android SDK 23+
- [Android NDK 10e](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases) 

First clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/realm/realm-js.git
```

Then in the cloned directory:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```Note: If you have cloned the repo previously make sure you remove your node_modules directory since it may contain stale dependencies which may cause the build to fail.```

### Building for iOS:
- Open `react-native/ios/RealmReact.xcodeproj`
- Select `RealmReact.framework` as the build target
- Build

### Building for Android:
- `cd react-native/android`
- `./gradlew publishAndroid`
- The compiled version of the Android module is here: `<project-root>/android`

### Building for nodejs:
Be sure you have python2.7 as the default python. 3.x won't work, and it's not enough to use `--python=python2.7` as parameter to npm.

```
npm install --build-from-source=realm
```

 - On Windows you will need to setup the environment for node-gyp

    * Option 1: Install windows-build-tools node package

         - Open an elevated command prompt (As Administrator)

            ```
            npm install -g --production windows-build-tools
            ```  

    * Option 2: Manually install and configure

        - Check [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) manual for custom installation procedure for Windows

## Issues with debugging
Some users have reported the Chrome debugging being too slow to use after integrating Realm into their react-native project. This is due to the blocking nature of the RPC calls made through the Realm library. It is an ongoing issue and we are actively working on fixing it. See https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/491 for more information.

## Running the tests

You can use `scripts/tests.sh` to run the various tests.
You will need yarn installed on the machine.

If you are testing against Realm Object Server (sync integration tests), you need to start the server before running `test.sh`. You do that by executing `./scripts/sync_test_server/start_servere.sh`. If you are testing RN Android, pleaase add the `-android` flag in order to forward ports.

test.sh options

 * eslint - lints the sources
 * react-tests - runs all React Native tests on iOS Simulator
 * react-tests-android runs all React Native Android tests on Android emulator
 * node - runs all tests for node
 * test-runners - checks supported tests runners are working correctly

On Windows some of these targets are available as npm commands.
```
npm run eslint
npm run node-tests
npm run test-runners
```

## Debugging the tests

You can attach a debugger to react-native tests by passing "Debug" to the tests.sh script. A Chrome browser will open and connect to the react native application. Use the built-in Chrome Debugger to debug the code.

```
./tests.sh react-tests Debug
```

Using Visual Studio Code

You can debug node tests using Visual Studio Code. Just use one of the launch configurations.
