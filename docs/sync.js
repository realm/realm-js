 *
 * Currently supported events:
 *
 *  * `'startup'`: Emitted when the listener start. It returns the Realm(s) matching the filter
 *    regex. A [ChangeEvent]{@link Realm.Sync.ChangeEvent} argument
 *    containing the `path` and `realm` properties (other [ChangeEvent]{@link Realm.Sync.ChangeEvent} 
 *    properties are N/A).    
 *  * `'available'`: Emitted whenever there is a new Realm which has a virtual
 *    path matching the filter regex, either due to the Realm being newly created
 *    or the listener being added. The virtual path (i.e. the portion of the
 *    URL after the protocol and hostname) is passed as an argument.
 *  * `'change'`: Emitted whenever the data within a Realm matching the filter
 *    regex has changed. A [ChangeEvent]{@link Realm.Sync.ChangeEvent} argument
 *    is passed containing information about which Realm changed and what
 *    objects within the Realm changed.
 *  * `'delete'`: Emitted whenever a Realm matching the filter regex has been
 *    deleted from the server. The virtual path of the Realm being deleted is
 *    passed as an argument.
 *
 * Worker automatically spawns child processes as needed to handle events in
 * parallel (up to the limit specified in the `options` parameter). Events for
 * each specific Realm will be processes in serial in the order in which the
 * events occurred, but may not all be processed in the same child.
 *

 * // my-worker.js
