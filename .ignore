# This file is used by tools like rg (AKA ripgrep) and fd to decide which
# files to examine, with a higher precidence than .gitignore.

# Don't hide source files generated by binding generator.
# This is a bit tricky because .gitignore drops whole paths.
# We need to unignore the whole dir, then re-ignore *, then
# unignore the files we want to see. Sigh.

# Everything here we want to see, so this one is easy.

# We also generate extracted .d.ts files into realm/generated/types,
# but those are redundant with the source files so we don't need to see them.
