([#3076](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/3076), since v10.0.0-beta.1)
* TS declaration for `create<T>(...)` has been relaxed when `Realm.UpdateMode` `All` or `Modified` is given. ([#3266](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3266))

### Compatibility
* MongoDB Realm Cloud.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous releases of Realm JavaScript in the 10.x.y series.

### Enhancements
* Adding the possibility of passing a string argument when constructing an App. ([#3082](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3082))
* `toJSON()` implemented for `Realm.Collection`, to return a nicer serializable Array. ([#3044](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3044))
* `Realm.JsonSerializationReplacer` exposed as a replacer (for usage with `JSON.stringify`) to handle circular structures.([#3044](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3044))
* TS: Stricter model validation for `create<T>(...)`. ([#3044](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3044))

* Fixed a crash when calling `user.apiKeys.fetchAll()`. ([#3067](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3067))
* Fixed calling `app.emailPasswordAuth.resetPassword` and `app.emailPasswordAuth.callResetPasswordFunction`, which would throw an error of mismatch in count of arguments. ([#3079](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/3079))
* realm.delete throws an exception `Argument to 'delete' must be a Realm object or a collection of Realm objects.` for schema objects defined with JS class syntax and not inheriting from RealmObject [#2848](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2848).

* Rare crash when a schema was updated ([#6680](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/6680))
* Bug in memory mapping management. This bug could result in multiple different asserts as well as segfaults. In many cases stack backtraces would include members of the EncyptedFileMapping near the top - even if encryption was not used at all. In other cases asserts or crashes would be in methods reading an array header or array element. In all cases the application would terminate immediately. (Realm Core PR #3838, since 7.0.0)

6.0.0 Release notes (2020-5-6)
=============================================================
NOTE: This version bumps the Realm file format to version 10. It is not possible to downgrade version 9 or earlier. Moreover, older files will automatically be upgraded to the new file format. Files created by Realm JavaScript prior to v1.0.0, might not be upgradeable. Only [Realm Studio 3.11](https://github.com/realm/realm-studio/releases/tag/v3.11.0) or later will be able to open the new file format.

### Breaking changes
* Calling `Realm.close()` on a closed Realm will throw an exception.
* Support of the old timestamp type has been removed, and older files cannot be upgraded. The new timestamp type was introduced in v1.0.0.
* `Realm.delete(Realm.Collection)` will conserve the order i.e., if a `Realm.Results` is [1, 2, 3] (pseudo-notation), `Realm.delete(2)` will produce [1, 3].
* It is only possible to compact a Realm when a single instance is open. Consider to use configuration parameter `shouldCompactOnLaunch` in the future.
* Schemas are not cached but will be reread when opening a Realm. This has an impact on default values as they are not persisted in the Realm files.

### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed
* None.

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 6.x.y series.

5.0.4 Release notes (2020-4-29)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed

* Replaced `decompress` with `node-tar` to avoid using vulnerable dependencies. ([#2773](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2773))
* Fixed TypeScript definitions, React Native debugger support and added documentation for `Realm.Sync.enableSessionMultiplexing()`. Thanks to @bimusiek. ([#2776](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2776))
* Fixed `obj.entries()` to return actual key/value pairs. Previously incorrectly returned key/`undefined` for all object keys. ([#2829](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2829), since v5.0.3)

### Fixed
* Realm Object properties not working when accessed, returning `undefined` on React Native for Android in Realm JS v5.0.2  ([#2763](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2763))
* Using `obj.keys()` or `obj.entries()` caused TypeScript error "Property 'keys' does not exist on type 'Object'". ([#2778](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2778), since v5.0.0)

5.0.0 Release notes (2020-3-18)
=============================================================
NOTE: This version has been pre-released as v3.7.0-alpha.0 and v3.7.0-alpha.2. We have bumped the major version due to removed functionality in this release. We are releasing this as v5.0.0 instead of v4.0.0 as we also have an series of pre-releases of v4.0.0 which are incompatible with this version as the Realm file format is upgraded. We have therefore decided to skip version v4.0.0, make this version 5.0.0 and we will then release the 4.0.0 version as the next major version - v6.0.0.

### Enhancements
* Added support for all Node.js versions from and above version 10. ([#2516](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2516))
* Helper methods `obj.keys()`, `obj.entries()` are now available to return the properties of that Realm Object, including the Realm properties defined by the schema.
* An instance method `toJSON()` is implemented on every Realm Object class to support `JSON.stringify()` to work as expected on every instance.

### Breaking changes
* Node.js 8 is not supported anymore.
* Realm objects properties are now defined as accessors on the instance prototype. Previously they were defined as values on the instance.
* Due to the accessor properties change above, calling `Object.keys()`, `Object.entries()`, and `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors()` on Realm.Object instances (objects from a Realm) will no longer return the Realm schema properties.

### Fixed
* ECMAScript 2015 Class syntax is fully supported by moving all properties to be accessors on the instance prototype allowing Realm JavaScript to invoke class constructors as constructors (using `new` instead of previously calling them as functions with 'call'). ([#998](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/998))

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (reads and upgrades all previous formats).

### Internal
* Complete rewrite of Realm JavaScript for Node.js on top of [Node.js N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html)
* Realm JavaScript is now binary compatible between Node.js versions (due to NAPI API stability and backward compatibility).

3.1.0 Release notes (2019-9-19)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Added support for Client Resync which can automatically recover the local Realm in case the server is rolled back. This largely replaces the Client Reset mechanism. It is configured using `Realm.Sync.Configuration.clientResyncMode`. Three modes are available: `'recover'`, `'discard`', and `'manual'` but currently only `'manual'` is supported for query-based sync. Default is `'recover'` for full sync and `'manual'` for query-based sync. ([#2328](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2328))

### Fixed
* Fixed check for if the partial sync schema needs to be initialized. ([realm/realm-object-store#843](https://github.com/realm/realm-object-store/pull/843))

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* None.


3.0.0 Release notes (2019-9-11)
=============================================================
### Breaking Changes
* Reworked the internal implementation of the permission API. For the most part, the method signatures haven't changed or where they have changed, the API have remained close to the original (e.g. `Results<T>` has changed to `T[]`).
  * Changed the return type of `User.getGrantedPermissions` from `Results<Permission>` to `Permission[]`. This means that the collection is no longer observable like regular Realm-backed collections. If you need to be notified for changes of this collection, you need to implement a polling-based mechanism yourself.
  * `Permission.mayRead/mayWrite/mayManage` have been deprecated in favor of a more-consistent `AccessLevel` API.
  * Removed the `User.openManagementRealm` method.
  * Changed the return type of `User.applyPermissions` from `Promise<PermissionChange>` to `Promise<void>`.

### Enhancements
* Added `User.getPermissionOffers` API to get a collection of all permission offers the user has created.

### Fixed
* Named pipes on Android are now created with 0666 permissions instead of 0600. This fixes a bug on Huawei devices which caused named pipes to change owners during app upgrades causing subsequent ACCESS DENIED errors. This should have no practical security implications. ([realm/realm-core#3328](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3328), since v0.10.0)
* fix error screen shown in React Native when refreshAdminToken and refreshAccessToken receive error result

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.23.1 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* Updated to Realm Core v5.23.2.
* Updated to Realm Sync v4.7.4.
* Add support for direct access to sync workers on Cloud, bypassing the Sync Proxy. [RJS-6](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RJS-6)

2.29.0 Release notes (2019-7-3)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* For synchronized Realms it is now possible to choose the behavior when opening the Realm. You can either choose to open the local Realm immediately or wait for it to be synchronized with the server first. These options are controlled through `Realm.Sync.SyncConfiguration.newRealmFileBehavior` and `Realm.Sync.SyncConfiguration.existingRealmFileBehavior`. See the [docs](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/2.29.0/api/Realm.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration) for more information.
* Added support for unicode characters in realm path and filenames for Windows. Thanks to @rajivshah3. ([realm-core#3293](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3293) and [#2319](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2319))

### Fixed
* A React Native iOS app could crash on the first launch. Thanks to @max-zu. ([#2400](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2400), since v1.0.0)
* When creating objects using migration, a native crash could occur if a new optional property was added to the schema. ([#1612](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/1612), since v1.0.0)
* Constructing an `inclusions` made unnecessary table comparisons. This resulted in poor performance for subscriptions using the `includeLinkingObjects` functionality. ([realm/realm-core#3311](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/issues/3311), since v2.27.0-rc.3)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.21.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* Updated to Object Store commit: 8cd7b40eb294c4292726a6215339742eea5107c9
* Updated to Realm Core v5.23.0
* Updated to Realm Sync v4.6.2


2.28.1 Release notes (2019-6-3)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed
* A bug in instruction cache invalidation could lead to SIGBUS errors on RN Android. ([#2391](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2391), since v2.28.0)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.21.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* None.


2.28.0 Release notes (2019-5-22)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Improve performance when using Chrome Debugging with React Native by adding caching and reducing the number of RPC calls required. Read-heavy workflows are as much as 10x faster. Write-heavy workflows will see a much smaller improvement, but also had a smaller performance hit to begin with. (Issue: [#491](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/491), PR: [#2373](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2373)).
* Reduce bundle size for React Native apps. Thanks to @lebedev. ([#2241](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2241))
* Support 64 bit for React Native Android. ([#2221](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2221))

### Fixed
* Opening a query-based Realm using `new Realm` did not automatically add the required types to the schema when running in Chrome, resulting in errors when trying to manage subscriptions. (PR: [#2373](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2373), since v2.15.0).
* The Chrome debugger did not properly enforce read isolation, meaning that reading a property twice in a row could produce different values if another thread performed a write in between the reads. This was typically only relevant to synchronized Realms due to the lack of multithreading support in the supported Javascript environments. (PR: [#2373](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2373), since v1.0.0).
* The RPC server for Chrome debugging would sometimes deadlock if a notification fired at the same time as a Realm function which takes a callback was called. (PR: [#2373](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2373), since v1.0.0 in various forms).

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.21.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* None.


2.27.0 Release notes (2019-5-15)
=============================================================
NOTE: The minimum version of Realm Object Server has been increased to 3.21.0 and attempting to connect to older versions will produce protocol mismatch errors. Realm Cloud has already been upgraded to this version, and users using that do not need to worry about this.

Changes since v2.26.1 (including v2.27.0-rc.2 and v2.27.0-rc.3):

### Enhancements
* Add an optional parameter to the `SubscriptionOptions`: `inclusions` which is an array of linkingObjects properties. This tells subscriptions to include objects linked through these relationships as well (links and lists are already included by default). ([#2296](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2296)
* Added `Realm.Sync.localListenerRealms(regex)` to return the list of local Realms downloaded by the global notifier. ([realm-js-private#521](https://github.com/realm/realm-js-private/issues/521)).
* Encryption now uses hardware optimized functions, which significantly improves the performance of encrypted Realms. ([realm-core#3241](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3241))
* Improved query performance when using `in` queries. ([realm-core#3241](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3241))
* Improved query performance when querying integer properties with indexes, e.g. primary key properties. ([realm-core#3272](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3272))
* Improved write performance when writing changes to disk. ([realm-core#2927](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/2927))

### Fixed
* Making a query that compares two integer properties could cause a segmentation fault in the server or x86 node apps. ([realm-core#3253](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/issues/3253))
* Fix an error in the calculation of the `transferable` value supplied to the progress callback. ([realm-sync#2695](https://github.com/realm/realm-sync/issues/2695), since v1.12.0)
* HTTP requests made by the Sync client now always include a `Host: header`, as required by HTTP/1.1, although its value will be empty if no value is specified by the application. ([realm-sync#2861](https://github.com/realm/realm-sync/pull/2861), since v1.0.0)
* Added `UpdateMode` type to support the three modes of `Realm.create()`. ([#2359](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2359), since v2.26.1)
* Fixed an issue where calling `user.logout()` would not revoke the refresh token on the server. ([#2348](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2348), since v2.24.0)
* Fixed types of the `level` argument passed to the callback provided to `Realm.Sync.setLogger`, it was a string type but actually a numeric value is passed. ([#2125](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2125), since v2.25.0)
* Avoid creating Realm instances on the sync worker thread. ([raas#1539](https://github.com/realm/raas/issues/1539) and [realm-object-store#793](https://github.com/realm/realm-object-store/pull/793))

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.21.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats).

### Internal
* Updated to Realm Core v5.19.1.
* Updated to Realm Sync v4.4.2.
* Updated to Object Store commit 3e48b69764c0a2aaaa7a3b947d6d0dae215f9a09.
* Building for node.js using Xcode 10.x supported.
* Fixed the Electron integration tests. ([#2286](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2286) and [#2320](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2320))
* Added `Realm.Sync.Adapter` implemetation.

2.26.0 Release notes (2019-4-4)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Add 4 new fields to `NamedSubscription` which reprents query-based subscriptions: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `expiresAt` and `timeToLive`. These make it possible to better reason about and control current subscriptions. ([#2266](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2266))
* Add the option of updating the query controlled by a subscription using either `Results.subscribe({name: 'name', update: true})` or the `NamedSubscription.query` property. ([#2266](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2266))
* Add the option of setting a time-to-live for subscriptions using either `Results.subscribe({name: 'name', timeToLive: <valueInMs>})` or the `NamedSubscription.timeToLive` property. ([#2266](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2266))
* Add `Realm.Results.description()` which returns a string representation of the query.
* Add support for defining mapped properties in the schema using `name: { type: 'int', mapTo: 'internalName' }`. In that case the mapped name is used internally in the underlying Realm file, while the property key is used for reading/writing the property as well as querying it.
* Add `RealmObject.addListener()`, `RealmObject.removeListener()`, and `RealmObject.removeAllListeners()` to set up and remove object-level notifications. ([#763](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/763))
* Add a new `Realm.UpdateMode` enum with the values: `never`, `modified`, `all`. This replaces the current
  `Realm.create(type, properties, update)` with `Realm.create(type, properties, updateMode)`.
  `Realm.create(type, properties, 'modified')` is a new mode that only update existing properties that actually
  changed, while `Realm.create(type, properties, 'never')` is equal to `Realm.create(type, properties, false)` and
  `Realm.create(type, properties, 'all')` is equal to `Realm.create(type, properties, true)`.
  `Realm.create(type, properties, update)` is now deprecated. ([#2089](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2089))

### Fixed
* Fixed retrying authentication requests. The issue could be observed as "Cannot read property 'get' of undefined." errors being thrown when the authenticate requests were retried. ([#2297](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2297), since v2.24.0)
* Due to a rare race condition in some Android devices (including Samsung SM-T111), an app could crash hard. A workaround was introduced but never included in any releases. ([#1895](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/1895), since v2.11.0)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* Updated to Object Store commit: ab91c2bb4a915c0f159291f08caf1dc13e717573
* Fixed adding a property to an existing object schema using the internal `realm._updateSchema`. ([#2283](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2283), since v2.24.0)

2.25.0 Release notes (2019-3-12)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Added `Realm.Sync.setLogger()` to capture the sync client's log. ([#2125](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2125) and [realm-js-private#517](https://github.com/realm/realm-js-private/issues/517))

### Fixed
* Fixed broken user auth functions when running in electron. ([#2264](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2264), since v2.24.0)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* Added `Realm.Sync.SyncConfiguration._sessionStopPolicy` for setting the behaviour of the sync session.
* Added `Realm.Sync._hasExistingSessions()` which returns `true` if Realm has a reference to any sync session regardless of its state. ([#2248](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2248))
* Implemented the integration tests using TypeScript.

2.24.0 Release notes (2019-2-27)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Add support for React Native v0.58. ([#2239](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2239))

### Fixed
* Fixed an assertion failure when using a synchronized Realm and an object was created after another object was created with an int primary key of `null`. ([#3227](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/pull/3227))
* When debugging with React Native, calling `Realm.open()` would crash since `Realm._asyncOpen()` was not available in the debugger. ([#2234](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2234), since v2.20.0)
* Added several missing functions to the Chrome debugging support library. ([#2242](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2242), since v2.2.19).
* Fixed incorrect results when reading data from Realm from within a callback function when debugging in Chrome. ([#2242](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2242)).
* Report the correct user agent to the sync server rather than always "RealmJS/Unknown". ([#2242](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2242), since v2.23.0).

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* Add integration tests running in various environments (Node.js on MacOS and Linux, React Native on iOS and Android & Electron main and renderer processes on Linux). Existing tests should eventually be migrated to this to ensure they pass in all relevant environments. ([#2227](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2227))
* Add the method `realm._updateSchema` to perform schema manipulation on an open Realm. Specifically creating an object schema and a property on an existing object schema are tested. It's undocumented as it's not fully tested and the API is subject to change. (partly solving [#2216](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2216))

2.23.0 Release notes (2019-2-1)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Added `Realm.copyBundledRealmFiles()` to TypeScript definitions. ([#2176](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2176))
* The parser now supports readable timestamps with a `T` separator in addition to the originally supported `@` separator. For example: `startDate > 1981-11-01T23:59:59:1`. ([realm/realm-core#3198](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/issues/3198))
* It is now possible to store Realms on Android external storage with React Native by using `Realm.Configuration.fifoFilesFallbackPath`. ([#2062](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2062))
* New global notifier API introduced though `Realm.Sync.addListener(config, event, callback)`. This also adds support for configuring the SSL connection. The old API `Realm.Sync.AddListener(serverUrl, adminUser, filterRegex, event, event, callback)` is deprecated. ([#2243](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2243))

### Fixed
* Realm initialized the filesystem when being imported instead of waiting for the first Realm to be opened. ([#2218] (https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2218), since v2.22.0)
* Sync sessions for Realms which were closed while the session was paused would sometimes not be cleaned up correctly. ([realm/realm-object-store#766](https://github.com/realm/realm-object-store/pull/766), since v2.16.0)
* Querying Realm instances obtained from `Realm.Sync.Adapter` would sometimes pin the read transaction version, resulting in the file rapidly growing in size as further transactions were processed. ([realm/realm-object-store#766](https://github.com/realm/realm-object-store/pull/766), since v2.0.2)
* Realm initialized the filesystem when being imported instead of waiting for the first Realm to be opened. ([#2218] (https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2218), since v2.22.0).

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.

* Reverted support for `n` as it prevents users to include Realm in iOS apps. We restore the old behaviour as a temporary solution, and we will reenable support of `n` in the near future. ([#2099](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2099), since v2.19.0-rc.5)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* Upgraded to Realm Core v5.12.5 (hanging on Windows).
* Upgraded to Realm Sync v3.14.3.

2.21.0 Release notes (2018-12-3)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Adds support for `Realm.Sync.reconnect()` that  will attempt to reconnect to the server immediately if the device has been offline.

### Fixed
* Fixed a bug that prevented admin token users from being properly deserialized when calling `User.deserialize`. ([#2155](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2155), since v2.16.0)
* `_initializeSyncManager` missing when debugging React Native in Chrome. Resulted in messages like `realmConstructor.Sync._initializeSyncManager is not a function` ([#2128](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2128), since v2.20.0)
* The `LIMIT` predicate on query-based sync Realms will now be evaluated after the permission check instead of before. Sometimes the predicates would not get all the objects matched.
* An index out of range error in query-based sync is fixed. The bug would manifest itself with a `list ndx out of range` assertion.
* If encryption was enabled, decrypted pages were not released until the file was closed, causing excessive usage of memory.

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

 ### Internal
* Upgraded to Realm Core v5.12.3 (releasing decrypted pages).
* Upgraded to Realm Sync v3.14.1 (`LIMIT` and out-of-range).

2.20.1 Release notes (2018-11-28)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed
* Using methods only available for Query-based Realms now throw a better error message if called on the wrong Realm file type. ([#2151](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2151))

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

 ### Internal
* None.

2.20.0 Release notes (2018-11-22)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Adds support for setting a custom User-Agent string using `Realm.Sync.setUserAgent(...)`. This string will be sent to the server when creating a connection. ([#2102](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2102))
* Adds support for uploading and downloading changes using `Realm.Sync.Session.uploadAllLocalChanges(timeout)` and `Realm.Sync.Session.downloadAllRemoteChanges(timeout)`. ([#2122](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2122))

### Fixed
* Tokens are refreshed ahead of time. If the lifetime of the token is lower than the threshold for refreshing it will cause the client to continously refresh, spamming the server with refresh requests. A lower bound of 10 seconds has been introduced. ([#2115](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2115), since v1.0.2)
* Prevent automatic token refreshes for Realms that have been closed. Previously, these could have resulted in obscure `Unhandled session token refresh error` messages in the logs that were benign. ([#2119](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2119))
* When trying to debug, users could experience a crash with the message `this._constructor is not a function`.  (https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/491#issuecomment-438688937, since v2.19.0-rc.4)
* Check the correct name when automatically adding the permission object schemas to the schema for query-based sync realms so that defining types with the same name works correctly. ([#2121](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2121), since 2.15.0)
* Fixes a bug where the JS engine might garbage collect an object prematurely leading to a native crash. ([#496](https://github.com/realm/realm-js-private/issues/496), since v2.19.0)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

### Internal
* Upgrades to Object Store commit: 66eea3994f598a388a775b93acb1c13603cc65c3
* Aligns better with Node 10 by not using deprecated calls. ([#2107](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2107), since v2.19.0)

2.19.1 Release notes (2018-11-15)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* None.

### Fixed
* The Typescript definition for `Realm.Permissions.Permission` did not have the correct `role` property defined. This could result in compilation errors like this `error TS2339: Property 'role' does not exist on type 'Permission'`. ([#2106](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2106), since v2.3.0.)
* Removes calls to `new Buffer()` as this is deprecated with Node 10. ([#2107](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2107), since v2.19.0)
* Updates the type definitions to be explicit that the return type of the generics `Realm.objects<T>`, `Realm.objectForPrimaryKey<T>`, etc. is an intersection of `T & Realm.Object`. ([#1838](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/1838))
* A set of bugs that could lead to bad changesets have been fixed. An example of error message is `Failed to parse, or apply received changeset: ndx out of range`. (Fixed by Realm Sync v3.13.3)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

 ### Internal
* Introduces 100 ms delay before submitting analytics so that an app may disable it after importing Realm. ([#2108](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2108))
* Distinguish between node.js and electron in the `BindingType` field when submitting analytics. ([#2108](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2108))
* Adds a package to compute the Windows analytics identifier rather than returning `null` which likely accounts for the disproportionally large number of unique Windows users. ([#2108](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2108))
* Upgrades to Realm Core v5.12.1.
* Upgrades to Realm Sync v3.13.4.

2.19.0 Release notes (2018-11-8)
=============================================================
This release contains all changes from v2.19.0-rc.1 to v2.19.0-rc.5.

### Enhancements
* Adds `SyncConfig.customQueryBasedSyncIdentifier` to allow customizing the identifier appended to the Realm path when opening a query based Realm. This identifier is used to distinguish between query based Realms opened on different devices and by default Realm builds it as a combination of a user's id and a random string, allowing the same user to subscribe to different queries on different devices. In very rare cases, you may want to share query based Realms between devices and specifying the `customQueryBasedSyncIdentifier` allows you to do that.
* Adds `Realm.subscriptions()` to query active query-based sync subscriptions. This method is in beta and might change in future releases. ([#2052](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2052))
* Adds `Realm.unsubscribe()` to unsubscribe by name an active query-based sync subscription. This method is in beta and might change in future releases. ([#2052](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2052))
* Improves the proactive token refresh mechanism to make several attempts to refresh the token before it expires and to also ensure that there is only one ongoing refresh timer for a combination of user and realm path. Previously it was possible to end up in a situation where many redundant refreshes were scheduled for the same Realm. ([#2071](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2071))
* A more meaningful exception will be thrown when trying to refresh the access token for a Realm with an invalid url. Previously, trying to connect to a Realm with an url that lacks the path component (e.g. `realm://foo.com`) would result in errors like `Cannot read property ‘token_data’ of undefined`. Instead, now we'll print out the Realm url and provide a more meaningful exception message. ([#ROS-1310](https://github.com/realm/realm-object-server-private/issues/1310))
* Adds support for Node 10. Pre-gyp'ed binaries are available for Node 6, 8, and 10. ([#1813](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/1813) and [#2087](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2087))
* Building for iOS can now use the `n` node version manager. Thanks to @SandyChapman! ([#2078](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2078))

### Fixed
* Fixes the TypeScript definitions for `User.login` to make it explicit in which cases a promise  and in which a `User` is returned. ([#2050](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2050), since 2.16.0).
* Fixes the exception being thrown when using the deprecated `User.registerWithProvider` API and not providing a value for `userInfo`. ([#2050](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2050), since 2.16.0).
* Fixes the signature of `user.logout` to return a `Promise<void>` rather than `void`. It has always done asynchronous work, but previously, it was impossible to be notified that the call has completed. Since that is now possible, the superfluous `User is logged out` message printed in the console upon logout has been removed. ([#2071](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2071), since v2.3.0)
* Fixes opening query-based Realms with a dynamic schema. Previously the schema would always contain only the types present when the Realm was first added and not any types added later. ([#2077](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2077), since v2.3.0)

### Compatibility
* Realm Object Server: 3.11.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.
* File format: Generates Realms with format v9 (Reads and upgrades all previous formats)

 ### Internal
* Upgrades to Realm Core v5.12.0.
* Upgrades to Realm Sync v3.13.1.
* Updates to `package.json` and `README.md`. Thanks to @hyandell.

2.19.0-rc.5 Release notes (2018-11-7)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* A more meaningful exception will be thrown when trying to refresh the access token for a Realm with an invalid url. Previously, trying to connect to a Realm with a url that lacks the path component (e.g. `realm://foo.com`) would result in errors like `Cannot read property ‘token_data’ of undefined`. Instead, now we'll print out the Realm url and provide a more meaningful exception message. ([#ROS-1310](https://github.com/realm/realm-object-server-private/issues/1310), since v1.0.2)

2.19.0-rc.1 Release notes (2018-10-9)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* Added `SyncConfig.customQueryBasedSyncIdentifier` to allow customizing the identifier appended to the realm path when opening a query based Realm. This identifier is used to distinguish between query based Realms opened on different devices and by default Realm builds it as a combination of a user's id and a random string, allowing the same user to subscribe to different queries on different devices.

2.18.0 Release notes (2018-10-4)
=============================================================
## Enhancements
* Added support for finding Realm-level permissions in Query-based Realms using `realm.getPermissions()`. ([#2036](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2036))
* Added support for finding Class-level permissions in Query-based Realms using `realm.getPermissions(className)`. ([#2036](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2036))
* Added `Realm.Permissions.Realm.findOrCreate(roleName)` and `Realm.Permissions.Class.findOrCreate(roleName)` which makes it easier to find or create permissions for a given role when using query-based Realms. ([#2036](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2036))

### Fixes
* Allow `Realm.deleteFile` to be used with a sync configuration. Previously, only local Realms could be deleted with this API and the `sync` property on the configuration would be ignored. ([#2045](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2045), since v1.0.0)

### Compatibility

* None.

### Fixes
* None.

### Compatibility
* File format: ver. 9 (upgrades automatically from previous formats)
* You will need to upgrade your Realm Object Server to at least version 3.11.0 or use [Realm Cloud](https://cloud.realm.io).
If you try to connect to a ROS v3.10.x or previous, you will see an error like `Wrong protocol version in Sync HTTP request, client protocol version = 25, server protocol version = 24`.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.

 ### Internal
* None.

2.17.0-rc.1 Release notes (2018-9-25)
=============================================================
### Enhancements
* When using a synced Realm where you only receive updates from the server and never update the realm locally, the client will now report download progress to the server such that it can compact files on the server. This enhancement doesn't affect the client.

### Compatibility
* File format: ver. 9 (upgrades automatically from previous formats)
* You will need to upgrade your Realm Object Server to at least version 3.11.0 or use [Realm Cloud](https://cloud.realm.io).
If you try to connect to a ROS v3.10.x or previous, you will see an error like `Wrong protocol version in Sync HTTP request, client protocol version = 25, server protocol version = 24`.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.

### Internal

2.16.2 Release notes (2018-9-25)
=============================================================
## Enhancements
* None.

### Fixes
* Fixed a bug where logging in using an admin token returned a promise. The correct behavior is to be synchronous. (related to [#2037](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2037), since v2.16.1)

* None.

### Fixes
* Fixed a bug in creating credentials using an admin token. The app would stop saying `then()` is not a function. ([#2037](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2037), since v2.16.0-rc.2)

### Compatibility
* File format: ver. 9 (upgrades automatically from previous formats)
* Realm Object Server: 3.0.0 or later.
* APIs are backwards compatible with all previous release of realm in the 2.x.y series.

### Internal

### Bug fixes
* Fixed the type definition for `Realm.Permissions.User`. Thanks to @apperside! ([#2012](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2012), since v2.3.0-beta.2)
* When adding a schema definition (e.g. `let config = user.createConfiguration(); config.schema = [Dog, Person]`) the permission schema would be removed, resulting in an `unknown object type __Permission` if using query based Realm. ([#2017](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2017), since v2.3.0).
* As part of including the permission schema implicitly when using query based Realm, the schema `Realm.Permissions.Realm` was missing, which may break any query including it. ([#2016](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2016), since v2.3.0)
* Fixed the type definition for `Realm.getPrivileges()`, `Realm.getPrivileges(className)` and `Realm.getPrivileges(object)`. ([#2030](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2030), since v2.2.14)

### Enhancements
* None

* File format: ver 9. (upgrades from previous formats automatically)


2.16.0-rc.2 Release notes (2018-9-14)
=============================================================
### Breaking changes
* None.

### Enhancements
* The authentication API has been completely revamped. ([#2002](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2002))
  * The following methods have been deprecated and will be removed at a next major version:
    * `Realm.Sync.User.login`
    * `Realm.Sync.User.register`
    * `Realm.Sync.User.authenticate`
    * `Realm.Sync.User.registerWithProvider`
    * `Realm.Sync.User.adminUser`
  * A new `Realm.Sync.User.login` method has been added that accepts the server url and a credentials object.
  * A new class - `Realm.Sync.Credentials` has been added that contains factory methods to create credentials with all supported providers.
  * Here are some examples on how to transform your old code to use the new API:

  | Old                                                                                                                                                                                                  | New                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `const user = await Realm.Sync.User.login(serverUrl, 'username', 'password');`                                                                                                                       | `const credentials = Realm.Sync.Credentials.usernamePassword('username', 'password');`<br/> `const user = await Realm.Sync.User.login(serverUrl, credentials);`                                                                                            |
  | `const jwtToken = 'acc3ssT0ken...';`<br>`const user = await Realm.Sync.User.registerWithProvider(serverUrl, 'jwt', jwtToken);`                                                                       | `const jwtToken = 'acc3ssT0ken...';`<br>`const credentials = Realm.Sync.Credentials.jwt(jwtToken);`<br>`const user = await Realm.Sync.User.login(serverUrl, credentials);`                                                                                 |
  | `const customToken = 'acc3ssT0ken...';`<br>`const userInfo = { someValue: true };`<br>`const user = await Realm.Sync.User.registerWithProvider(serverUrl, 'custom/fooauth', customToken, userInfo);` | `const customToken = 'acc3ssT0ken...';`<br>`const userInfo = { someValue: true };`<br>`const credentials = Realm.Sync.Credentials.custom('custom/fooauth', customToken, userInfo);`<br>`const user = await Realm.Sync.User.login(serverUrl, credentials);` |
* Exposed `Realm.Sync.User.serialize()` to create a persistable representation of a user instance, as well as `Realm.Sync.User.deserialize()` to later inflate a `User` instance that can be used to connect to Realm Object Server and open synchronized Realms. ([#1276](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/1276))
* Added `Realm.Sync.Session.pause()` and `Realm.Sync.Session.resume()` to allow controlling when to sync data. ([#2014](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/2014))
* Added support for `LIMIT` in queries to restrict the size of the results set. This is in particular useful for query-based synced Realms. An example of the syntax is `age >= 20 LIMIT(2)`. ([#2008](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/pull/2008))

### Bug fixes

* [Sync] Added `Realm.Results.subscribe()` to subscribe to partial synced Realms.

  - Permissions are enforced by the object server but connectivity is not required.
  - Method `Realm.privilges()` to compute privileges on a Realm, a Realm object schema, or a Realm object. The method returns either a `Realm.Permissions.Realm` or `Realm.Permissions.Class` object.
  - For non-synced Realms, all privileges are always granted.
  - For more details, please read the reference documentation.
