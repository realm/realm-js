 * The following Instructions can be returned by `Adapter.current(path)`. Each instruction object has

 * that will exist in the instruction object.
 * @typedef Realm.Sync.Adapter~Instruction
 * @type {(INSERT|SET|DELETE|CLEAR|CHANGE_IDENTITY|LIST_SET|LIST_INSERT|LIST_ERASE|LIST_CLEAR|ADD_TYPE|ADD_PROPERTY)}
 * @property INSERT - insert a new object
 * - `object_type` - type of the object being inserted
 * - `identity` - primary key value or row index for the object
 * - `values` - map of property names and property values for the object to insert
 * @property SET - set property values for an existing object
 * - `object_type` - type of the object
 * - `identity` - primary key value or row index for the object
 * - `values` - map of property names and property values to update for the object
 * @property DELETE - delete an exising object
 * - `object_type` - type of the object
 * - `identity` - primary key value or row index for the object
 * @property CLEAR - delete all objects of a given type
 * - `object_type` - type of the object
 * @property LIST_SET - set the object at a given list index to an object
 * - `object_type` - type of the object
 * - `identity` - primary key for the object
 * - `property` - property name for the list property to mutate
 * - `list_index` - list index to set
 * - `object_identity` - primary key or row number of the object being set
 * @property LIST_INSERT - insert an object in the list at the given index
 * - `object_type` - type of the object
 * - `identity` - primary key for the object
 * - `property` - property name for the list property to mutate
 * - `list_index` - list index at which to insert
 * - `object_identity` - primary key or row number of the object to insert
 * @property LIST_ERASE - erase an object in the list at the given index - this removes the object
 * from the list but the object will still exist in the Realm
 * - `object_type` - type of the object
 * - `identity` - primary key for the object
 * - `property` - property name for the list property to mutate
 * - `list_index` - list index which should be erased
 * @property LIST_CLEAR - clear a list removing all objects - objects are not deleted from the Realm
 * - `object_type` - type of the object
 * - `identity` - primary key for the object
 * - `property` - property name for the list property to clear
 * @property ADD_TYPE - add a new type
 * - `object_type` - name of the type
 * - `primary_key` - name of primary key property for this type
 * - `properties` - Property map as described in {@link Realm~ObjectSchema}
 * @property ADD_PROPERTIES - add properties to an existing type
 * - `object_type` - name of the type
 * - `properties` - Property map as described in {@link Realm~ObjectSchema}
 * @property CHANGE_IDENTITY - change the row index for an existing object - not called for objects
 * with primary keys
 * - `object_type` - type fo the object
 * - `identity` - old row value for the object
 * - `new_identity` - new row value for the object
