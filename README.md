![Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/raw/master/logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This project hosts the JavaScript versions of [Realm](https://realm.io/). Currently we only support React Native (both iOS & Android) and Node.js (on MacOS and Linux) but we are considering adding support for Cordova/PhoneGap/Ionic as well.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/#models) and [queryable by code](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/#queries), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, and vectorization.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.

## Getting Started

Please see the detailed instructions in our docs to use [Realm Javascript](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/#getting-started).

## Building Realm

In case you don't want to use the precompiled version on npm, you can build Realm yourself from source. You’ll need an Internet connection the first time you build in order to download the core library.

Prerequisites:
- Node 4.0+
- Xcode 7.2+
- Android SDK 23+
- Android NDK 10e+

First clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/realm/realm-js.git
```

Then in the cloned directory:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```Note: If you have cloned the repo previously make sure you remove your node_modules directory since it may contain stale dependencies which may cause the build to fail.```

To build for iOS:
- Open `react-native/ios/RealmReact.xcodeproj`
- Select `RealmReact.framework` as the build target
- Build

To build for Android:
- `cd react-native/android`
- `./gradlew publishAndroid`
- The compiled version of the Android module is here: `<project-root>/android`

To build for nodejs:

```
npm install --build-from-source
```

 - On Windows you will need to setup the environment for node-gyp

    - Option 1: Install windows-build-tools node package

         - Open an elevated command prompt (As Administrator)

            ```
            npm install -g --production windows-build-tools
            ```  

    * Option 2: Manually install and configure

        - Check [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) manual for custom installation procedure for Windows


## Running the tests

You can use scripts/tests.sh to run the various tests.
You will need yarn installed on the machine.

test.sh options

 * eslint - lints the sources
 * react-tests - runs all React Native tests on iOS Simulator
 * react-tests-android runs all React Native Android tests on Android emulator
 * node - runs all tests for node
 * test-runners - checks supported tests runners are working correctly

On Windows some of these targets are available as npm commands.
```
npm run eslint
npm run node-tests
npm run test-runners
```

## Debugging the tests

You can attach a debugger to react-native tests by passing "Debug" to the tests.sh script. A Chrome browser will open and connect to the react native application. Use the built-in Chrome Debugger to debug the code.

```
./tests.sh react-tests Debug
```

Using Visual Studio Code

You can debug node tests using Visual Studio Code. Just use one of the launch configurations.
