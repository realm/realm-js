/**
 * A Realm Worker can be used to process Sync events in multiple automatically-managed child processes.
 *
 * Similar to Web Workers, a Worker is initialized by passing it the name of a module which should be loaded in the new process.
 * The module should export a function for each even type it wishes to handle, which will be called when that event is emitted.
 *
 * Currently supported events:
 *
 *  * `'available'`: Emitted whenever there is a new Realm which has a virtual
 *    path matching the filter regex, either due to the Realm being newly created
 *    or the listener being added. The virtual path (i.e. the portion of the
 *    URL after the protocol and hostname) is passed as an argument.
 *  * `'change'`: Emitted whenever the data within a Realm matching the filter
 *    regex has changed. A [ChangeEvent]{@link Realm.Sync.ChangeEvent} argument
 *    is passed containing information about which Realm changed and what
 *    objects within the Realm changed.
 *  * `'delete'`: Emitted whenever a Realm matching the filter regex has been
 *    deleted from the server. The virtual path of the Realm being deleted is
 *    passed as an argument.
 *
 * Worker automatically spawns child processes as needed to handle events in
 * parallel (up to the limit specified in the `options` parameter). Events for
 * each specific Realm will be processes in serial in the order in which the
 * events occurred, but may not all be processed in the same child.
 *
 * @example
 * // my-worker.js
 * function onavailable(path) {
 *    console.log(`Realm available at ${path}`);
 * }
 *
 * function onchange(change) {
 *    console.log(`Realm at ${change.path} changed`);
 * }
 *
 * function ondelete(path) {
 *    console.log(`Realm at ${path} deleted`);
 * }
 *
 * module.exports = {onchange, oncavailable, ondelete};
 *
 * // server script
 * Realm.Sync.addListener(realmServerURL, adminUser, '.*', new Realm.Worker('my-worker'));
 *
 * @memberof Realm
