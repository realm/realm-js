2.3.0 Release notes (2018-3-7)
=============================================================
### Breaking changes
* [Sync] Sync protocol changed to version 24.
* [Sync] History schema format for server-side Realm files bumped to version 4. This means that after the server has been upgraded, it cannot be downgraded again without restoring state from backup.
* [Sync] `Realm.subscribeToObjects()` has been removed. Use `Realm.Results.subscribe()` instead.

### Enhancements
* [Sync] Reduced initial download times in Realms with long transaction histories.
* [Sync] Wait for pending notifications to complete when removing a sync listener (1648).
* Enabled sort and distinct in the query string. If sort or distinct are also applied outside of the query string, the conditions are stacked.
  - Example syntax: `age > 20 SORT(name ASC, age DESC) DISTINCT(name)`
  - The ordering for sorting can be one of the following case insensitive literals: `ASC`, `ASCENDING`, `DESC`, `DESCENDING`.
  - Any number of properties can appear inside the brackets in a comma separated list.
  - Any number of sort/distinct conditions can be indicated, they will be applied in the specified order.
  - Sort or distinct cannot operate independently, these conditions must be attached to at least one query filter.
* [Sync] Added `Realm.Results.subscribe()` to subscribe to partial synced Realms.
* [Sync] Added class `Realm.Sync.Subscription` and enum `Realm.Sync.SubscriptionState` to support partial synced Realms.
* [Sync] Added an object-level permission subsystem. It is possible to grant fine-grained priviliges to users.
* Added object-level permissions:
  - Schemas `Realm.Permissions.Realm`, `Realm.Permissions.Class`, `Realm.Permissions.Role`, `Realm.Permissions.User`, and `Realm.Permissions.Permission` to support working with permissions. These schemas can be used in user-defined Realms and schemas.
  - Permissions are enforced by the object server but connectivity is not required.
  - Method `Realm.privilges()` to compute privileges on a Realm, a Realm object schema, or a Realm object. The method returns either a `Realm.Permissions.Realm` or `Realm.Permissions.Class` object.
  - For non-synced Realms, all privileges are always granted.
  - For more details, please read the reference documentation.
* [Sync] Revoke refresh tiken upon logout (#1354).
