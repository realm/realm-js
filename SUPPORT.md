# Support

The Realm team is here to help you with your Realm-related issues!

## Documentation

Before asking questions, please familiarize yourself with our [Node.js](docs/node/README.md) and [React Native](docs/react-native/README.md) documentation.

## Tiers

It is exciting to have users, and we want to support you as good as possible. Our community support (Github issues in this and our related repositories) is divided into three tiers, and below you can see which packages, versions and platforms we consider for the different tiers.

If you want to contribute to any of our packages, you are welcome to do so. We will take the time to review your pull request for any package.

### Tier 1 - fully supported

In tier 1 we will respond to issues in a timely manner during workdays from CET timezone, and we will work on bug fixing and adding new features.

* [`realm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm) (NPM tag: `latest`) on node.js (active LTS) and Electron on Windows, MacOS, and Linux
* [`realm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm) (NPM tag: `latest`) with the latest React Native version 0.71.0 on Android and iOS
* [`@realm/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@realm/react) (NPM tag: `latest`) in conjunction with the latest [`realm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm) release

### Tier 2 - best effort

Some packages are considered to be mature and stable, and we will support them as good as we can when time permits.

* [`realm-web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm-web) (NPM tag: `latest`)
* [Realm Studio](https://github.com/realm/realm-studio) ([latest](https://github.com/realm/realm-studio/releases/latest) release) on Windows, MacOS, and Linux
* Any other release of [`realm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm) not covered by tier 1

### Tier 3 - experimental

The third tier covers our experimental packages. We work on them occasionally, and they are likely to change radically when we do.

* [`@realm/babel-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@realm/babel-plugin)

## MongoDB Developer Community

If you have questions about configuring or using Realm you can ask the [MongoDB Developer Community](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/).

When asking questions on the MongoDB Developer Community forums, please keep in mind the [guidelines](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/guidelines), and please use the search functionality to see if your question has been asked before.

## GitHub Issues

If you are running into issues with Realm, including potential bugs or feature requests, we encourage you to file an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues). Please check out our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to properly file an issue.

We greatly appreciate demonstration projects that we can run for ourselves in order to see issues or potential bugs; we prioritize clearly-written tickets that include reproduction cases. You may attach these to the ticket; let us know if you need to share them confidentially, and we’ll provide instructions on how to do so.
