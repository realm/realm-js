Simple Expo template to quickly get started with Realm and Realm types.

## üöÄ How to use

> `npx expo-cli MyAwesomeRealmApp -t @realm/expo-template-ts`

- Run `expo start --dev-client`, try it out.

## üèó Build with EAS

You can easily use this project with `EAS` - just follow the steps below.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prepare project

- adjust value of `ios.bundleIdentifier` and `android.package` in `app.json`
- run `eas build:configure`

### üí™ Build whatever you want

This example comes with two pre-configured build types: `release` (a production version of your app - ready to be uploaded to stores), `with-dev-client` (a development version of your app that can be shared with your teammates).

To build the app with the dev client, just run `eas build --profile with-dev-client`.

> **Note**: the `with-dev-client` uses the **internal distribution** on **iOS**. That's why, you need to add your device to be able to install the built app. To do it, you can use `eas device:create`.

**For more information about EAS, check out [documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/).**
